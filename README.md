# Cybersecurity Playbook

This repository serves as a leadership-focused toolkit for building and sustaining resilient cybersecurity operations. It includes real-world templates, strategic frameworks, and practical automation scripts based on 18+ years of experience across military and mission-critical environments.

---

## Purpose

This playbook bridges the gap between technical implementation and strategic oversight. It’s designed for cybersecurity leaders, CISOs, and mission owners responsible for safeguarding critical systems, enabling compliance, and preventing operational failure.

## Incident Response Template

This template outlines a structured approach to identifying, containing, resolving, and learning from cybersecurity incidents.

**Key elements include:**
- Classification of severity and scope
- Containment, eradication, and recovery steps
- Documentation for lessons learned and future prevention
- Appendix for logs, artifacts, and timelines

## Risk Register Template

This Excel-based template demonstrates risk-based decision-making using a structured scoring model (Likelihood x Impact) with clear ownership and mitigation tracking.

**Key features include:**
- Risk ID and detailed descriptions
- Likelihood & impact scoring (1–5 scale)
- Automated risk score (LxI)
- Assigned owners
- Residual risk evaluation

## Zero Trust Implementation Guide

This document outlines a high-level strategy for implementing Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) in mission-critical environments.

**Key elements include:**
- Protect surface identification
- Microsegmentation design
- Role-based access controls (RBAC/ABAC)
- Identity-aware network architecture
- Continuous monitoring and behavior analysis

 [View the guide](./frameworks/zero_trust_implementation.md)

This demonstrates executive-level understanding of modern security frameworks and the ability to translate them into actionable architecture.

## Guiding Principles

- **Secure by design** – Prevent rather than react  
- **Ethical leadership** – Build trust through transparency and accountability  
- **Scalable security** – Align with mission size, complexity, and risk  
- **People-first posture** – Empower teams without sacrificing safety
